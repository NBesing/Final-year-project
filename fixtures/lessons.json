Adding JavaScript to the HTML file allows you to add behavior and interactivity to the web page.\n\nImmediate Execution\nWhenever the browser finds a <script> tag on the web page, it immediately executes the JavaScript code defined inside that. It enables website visitors to interact with the web pages and get real-time updates immediately.\n\nInline and External scripts\nYou can use the <script> tag to add the inline or external script into the HTML file. If you want to load JavaScript before the HTML of a web page, you can add the <script> tag in the <head> tag. Otherwise, you can add the <script> tag in the <body> tag.\n\nExternal Libraries and Frameworks integration\nThe <script> tag enables you to add external libraries and frameworks to the HTML web page.\n\nFor example, in the below code, we have added JQuery to the web page using its CDN.",

One of the most fundamental characteristics of a programming language is the set of data types it supports. These are the types of values that can be represented and manipulated in a programming language.\n\nJavaScript data types can be categorized as primitive and non-primitive (object). JavaScript (ES6 and higher) allows you to work with seven primitive data types −\n\n- Strings of text, e.g., \"This text string\"\n- Numbers, e.g., 123, 120.50\n- Boolean, e.g., true or false\n- null\n- undefined\n- BigInt\n- Symbol\n\nBigInt and Symbol are introduced in ES6. In ES5, there were only five primitive data types.\n\nIn addition to these primitive data types, JavaScript supports a composite data type known as an object. We will cover objects in detail in a separate chapter.\n\nThe Object data type contains the following sub-data types −\n\n- Object\n- Array\n- Date",

For example, the var and let keywords are used to define variables, the function keyword is used to define the functions, etc. JavaScript contains more than fifty reserved keywords.\n\nIn simple terms, you can't use the reserved keywords as an identifier. If you do, you will get the conflicts, and the code will generate the wrong output or throw an error.",
